For my final project, I am planning to examine the relationship between student performance
and teacher perceptions of their school's learning environment using Pittsburgh Public Schools data.

Last year, I was a substitute teacher for PPS and taught in 22 schools. I spent a lot of time looking at the data on all the schools I
taught at as well, and saw the numbers come to life as I went into each school.

One data point collected for each school is the percentage of teachers who describe it as a good place to work and learn. I was struck
by how much high-scoring schools on this metric felt noticeably warmer and friendlier. I noticed that schools with unpleasant environments
had abysmal test scores, but that pleasant environments were a very mixed bag in terms of student achievement.

Two examples in particular stuck out to me: Allegheny Traditional Academy 6-8 (ATA) and Arsenal 6-8. Both were very friendly, pleasant
environments where teachers clearly cared about their students. Demographically, both were about 90% black and 90% economically disadvantaged.
But there the similarities ended. Arsenal ran a tight ship and expected a lot from its students. ATA was decidedly looser. Very few ATA
students were considered proficient in core subjects. Arsenal, despite its demographics, was one of the highest performing schools in the
city. When I talked with teachers and staff at Arsenal to figure out what made it so successful, everyone agreed it was about organization
and consistent high expectations for all students. As one teacher told me, they were "warm demanders," a popular concept in education that
inspired me to choose this project.

I want to map out Pittsburgh's public schools on a 2x2 matrix of warmth and demandingness. My theory is that teacher perceptions of
teaching/learning environment can serve as a proxy for warmth, while year-to-year average student improvement can be a proxy for demandingness
(i.e. holding students to high standards).
Obviously these are highly imperfect proxies. They are based on the assumptions that warm feelings towards schools translate to warm
feelings towards students and that high standards translate to high performance, both of which should be taken with a grain of salt,
but I believe they are reasonable enough as long as I am transparent about them.


I am going to use visualizations to explore the data, so I do not yet know exactly what I will find, but here are some preliminary
findings from the quick Excel visualizations I've done since compiling the data:
* Based on my metric, most schools in PPS are very high-warmth
* Warmth is necessary but not sufficient for student improvement
** Students fell behind in every school where a majority of teachers did not describe the working/learning environment positively
*** This effect is strong enough that, despite a tiny sample size, the difference between schools above and below this threshold is statistically significant for math
** Once the 50% threshold is crossed for warmth, the relationship between warmth and improvement becomes less clear
*** Schools with >92% positive reviews from teachers perform significantly WORSE than 50% < warmth <= 92% (p=0.005)
