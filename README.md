A portfolio of my work for my "Telling Stories with Data Class"

# About me
My name is Moses Hetfield (pronouns: he/him) and I am a first-year Master's student at Carnegie Mellon's Heinz College, studying Public Policy, Management, and Data Analytics. Before I started at Heinz, I worked as a substitute teacher for Pittsburgh Public Schools, teaching at 22 schools over the past year. I would say to ask me about Pittsurgh's school system, but I get too excited about it and you'll have trouble getting me to stop talking, so ask at your own risk! I studied history as an undergrad and I love reading both fiction and non-fiction, so I'm always happy to exchange book recommendations. My other hobbies include singing and baking bread.

# What I hope to learn
I've always loved data visualizations ever since, as a small child, I would count up all my Halloween candy every year and make a graph showing how much of each candy I received. I hope this class teaches me both the technical skills and principles of design to create more sophisticated ways to represent data. My goal is to learn how to take complex, messy data and turn it into something beautiful, comprehensible, and accessible. After I graduate, I am hoping to either go into public sector consulting or work for a municipal government, and I believe in either case my ability to convey information visually will make me more effective.
